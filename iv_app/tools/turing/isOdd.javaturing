IS_ODD_TURING_PROGRAM

This program will alternatively print 0, then 1, then 0, then 1....on the tape

It is a very simple program that could be interpreted as:
    - non-integer part of 1/3 in binary
    - isOdd(x) where x goes from 0, 1, 2, 3, .... N
    - 1 in unary many many many times, separated by 0
    - art?
